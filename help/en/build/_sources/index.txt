Presentation
*****************
It happens quite often to encounter a bug in the SVG export of a print composer, causing the creation of a map with vectors overflowing their frame.

This occurs when in the composer, the user-defined frame or scale of the map does not cover the entire footprint of the selected vector layers.

*Example of a bug when exporting Qgis SVG :*

   :align: center
   :height: 421 px

This plugin has been designed to overcome this problem and avoid a post-processing in a vector graphics editor.

*SVG export with Cut2SVG :*

.. index:: Pr√©-requis


Prerequisites
================= 

| The CRS of the layers to be cut must be identical to the CRS of the project. 
| If this is not the case, the plugin will display an alert message.

| Also check the validity of the geometries of the vector layers.
| In case of invalidity, the plugin will display the name of the layers concerned and their number of errors.


.. index:: Fonctionnement


Operation
================= 

* Check that all layers (vector as raster) in the composer are enabled in the main Qgis interface.


* Select the print composer and map you want to work on.
  The plugin displays the coordinates of the footprint of the selected map and opens the composer concerned.
  A zoom is made in the canvas on the corresponding right-of-way, delimited by a blue rectangle, making it easier to find your way in the choice of the map.

* Specify an export folder, then start the process.

| The relevant vector layers will then be duplicated and cut by a temporary polygon corresponding to the footprint of the selected map in the print composer.
| In the interface, these new layers will be found in a new group called "Cut2SVG".
| Finally, the original vector layers will be disabled while their cut clones will resume their symbology.
| The composer will be updated for direct viewing of the result.

It will only remain to export the composer in SVG.
